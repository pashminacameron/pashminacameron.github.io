About Pashmina Cameron
============================

I am an engineer and researcher interested in applying the latest machine learning research to solve real-world challenges, with the ultimate goal to improve inclusion and access to opportunity for everyone. My current interests include generative modelling for computer vision. I am also interested in both stochastic and code optimization. 

Previously, at Microsoft Research Cambridge, I worked on a number of projects including: 

- `Project HSD <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hsd/>`_, an optical storage system which uses machine learning for storing data in holographic crystals with high powered lasers
- `Project Silica <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-silica/>`_, a sustainable optical storage system which uses machine learning for storing data in glass with high speed lasers
- `Generative Chemistry <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/generative-chemistry/>`_, a workflow containing generative models for predicting new drug molecules and multi-property optimization, now used in-house by Novartis [`Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74ZD68ZWd34>`_]
- `Human motion modelling <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/flag-flow-based-3d-avatar-generation-from-sparse-observations/>`_, a system for predicting avatar human motion from sparse head mounted device signals [`Web <https://microsoft.github.io/flag/>`_] 

I also co-ran the MSR Cambridge AI Residency program for three years and managed teams of various sizes. 

Before joining Microsoft Research Cambridge in 2018, I led a computer vision R&D team (now part of MicroFocus) at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. My research spanned areas such as SLAM, 3D reconstruction and 3D change detection, augmented reality. I also developed industrial computer vision solutions for face recognition, object detection and recognition, license plate recognition and intelligent scene analysis. 

I did a PhD in computer vision from University of Cambridge on a `Gates Cambridge Scholarship <https://www.gatescambridge.org/>`_. In a previous life, I built commercial foreign exchange software at Integral which is still being used full-steam today.
