About Pashmina Cameron
============================

I am a Principal RSE Lead at Microsoft Research Cambridge. 

Before joining MSR in 2018, I worked at Autonomy (part of HP/Hewlett Packard Enterprise/Micro Focus) leading their Computer Vision R&D team and was responsible for shipping IDOL MediaServer. Prior to 2011, (as Pashmina Bendale), I did a PhD in Signal Processing Lab, University of Cambridge on a Gates Cambridge Scholarship. My thesis was titled "Development and evaluation of a multiscale keypoint detector based on complex wavelets". In a previous life, I have built commercial foreign exchange software which is still being used full-steam today.
